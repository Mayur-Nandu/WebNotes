            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
            typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the indu
            stry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, w
            hen an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
            it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
            five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages
            , <div>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus Page</div>
            Maker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            <span>  Why do we use it?</span>It is a long established fact that a reader
            will be distracted by the readable content of
            a page when looking at its layout. The point
            of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
            normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
            <b>'Content here, content here', making it look like readable </b>
            English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page 
            editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
            and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
            sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
            evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
            on purpose (injected humour and the like).
            Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
            simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
            classical Latin literature from 45 BC
